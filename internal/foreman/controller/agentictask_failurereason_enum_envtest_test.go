// Every AgenticTaskFailureReason the executor can emit has to be a member of
// the CRD failureReason enum. If it is not, the apiserver rejects the terminal
// status patch with IsInvalid and the reason never reaches status -- watcher.go
// catches the Invalid error and takes the defensive fallback, so the intended
// verdict/reason is lost. RebaseConflictUnresolved regressed exactly this way
// (#1840): the constant existed but the kubebuilder enum marker omitted it, so
// the generated CRD did not carry it.
//
// allReasons is maintained by hand: it pins the reasons listed below against
// the live CRD, not literally every declared const. A brand-new reason still
// has to be added both to the enum marker AND to this slice -- the guard does
// not discover reasons on its own. What it does guarantee is that every reason
// listed here is a member of the generated CRD enum.
