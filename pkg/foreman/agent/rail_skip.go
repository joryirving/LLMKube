// Rail-skip observability (#1605).
//
// A single `repo.DiffNameOnly` call feeds four reviewer rails. When it fails
// or returns nothing, every one of them loses its input at once, which is the
// mechanism #1570 named: the safety net is disabled by the same condition that
// creates the hazard. Two of the four already returned the model's verdict
// silently, so a verdict nothing checked was indistinguishable afterwards from
// one that earned it.
//
// These helpers make that visible. They never change a verdict: demoting
// because a check could not run destroys good work, which is the #1552 lesson.

// railsSkippedKey is the single extra key recording every rail that could not
// run on a task, as "<rail>: <reason>" entries. One key rather than a marker
// per rail, because the operational question is "did anything fail to run on
// this verdict?" and answering it should not require knowing every rail's name.
const railsSkippedKey = "railsSkipped"

// Rail names. Used in railsSkipped entries and, for the rails that can
// rewrite a verdict, in the verdictDemotedBy marker those rails stamp. The
// demoting rails take their names from pkg/foreman/agent/reviewer so the
// controller, which reads verdictDemotedBy back out of the result envelope
// and cannot import this package, compares against the same strings (#1636).
