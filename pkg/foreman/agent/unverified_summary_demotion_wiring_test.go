// Production-path test for the #1454 unverified-summary rail. runLLMPath runs
// enforceReviewerUnverifiedSummary inside the reviewer block: a GO whose
// terminal summary admits in plain language that verification could not be
// performed must come out of Execute as a NO-GO carrying the demotion markers
// inertDemotion (internal/foreman/controller) keys off.
//
// This drives the REAL rail through Execute -> runLLMPath -> the reviewer
// block (not a direct call to the helper), and asserts the markers on
// modelExtra. Mutation check: remove the enforceReviewerUnverifiedSummary
// call from runLLMPath and this test fails, because the verdict stays GO and
// none of the demotion markers ever reach modelExtra. A test that called
// enforceReviewerUnverifiedSummary directly would still pass with the call
// site removed -- this one cannot.
//
// The other rails are kept out of the picture by construction: the fetched
// issue body names no files, so the scope-overlap rail skips
// (no-path-refs-in-issue) instead of demoting; the submit envelope's issueAsk
// is a verbatim substring of that body, so reconcileReviewerIssueAsk marks it
// verified and the issueAsk rail returns without touching the verdict; and
// findings are empty, so the verdict-from-findings rail has nothing to
// promote. The unverified-summary rail is the only actor. The summary is the
// windowstead#321 incident that motivated the rail.

// submitGOUnverifiedSummary mirrors a reviewer approval whose summary admits
// verification could not be performed.
