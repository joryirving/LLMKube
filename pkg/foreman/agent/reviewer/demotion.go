package reviewer

// Verdict-demotion markers.
//
// A harness rail may rewrite a reviewer's verdict. When one touches a
// verdict it stamps the reviewer's submit_result extra with verdictDemoted
// (true), verdictClaimed (the archived original verdict), demotionReason
// (prose), and verdictDemotedBy: the name of the rail that made the call.
//
// verdictDemotedBy exists because the bare flag cannot say WHICH rail acted,
// and the consumers do not want the same answer from each (#1636). The
// issueAsk rail demotes when it cannot prove the reviewer read the issue:
// that is a statement about verification confidence, and re-running the
// coder cannot change it. The scope-overlap rail demotes when the diff
// touches none of the files the issue names: that is a statement about the
// diff, and the coder CAN act on it. The unverified-summary rail demotes a
// GO whose own summary admits verification could not be performed (#1454):
// a statement about the review environment, not the change, and re-running
// the coder cannot change it either. A consumer keying off verdictDemoted
// alone conflates the three.
//
// The names live here, in the leaf package that already defines the
// reviewer's submit_result.extra contract, because the producer
// (pkg/foreman/agent's rails) and the consumer (internal/foreman/controller)
// both need the same strings and neither imports the other. A rail name
// that exists only inside pkg/foreman/agent is one the controller's
// inertDemotion predicate can never match, which is how unverified-summary
// demotions silently drove futile fix iterations before this constant
// existed.
